abstract: analyzeAudio is a Python package for measuring aspects of audio files.
  It provides comprehensive audio analysis capabilities including spectral 
  measurements (centroid, contrast, flatness, etc.), loudness metrics (LUFS, 
  RMS), temporal features (tempo, zero-crossing rate), and signal quality 
  assessments (SRMR). The library integrates with FFmpeg/FFprobe for efficient 
  analysis and supports both single file and batch processing with concurrent 
  execution.
