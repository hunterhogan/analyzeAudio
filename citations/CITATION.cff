abstract: analyzeAudio is a Python package for measuring aspects of audio files. It
  provides comprehensive audio analysis capabilities including spectral measurements
  (centroid, contrast, flatness, etc.), loudness metrics (LUFS, RMS), temporal features
  (tempo, zero-crossing rate), and signal quality assessments (SRMR). The library
  integrates with FFmpeg/FFprobe for efficient analysis and supports both single file
  and batch processing with concurrent execution.
